This is the repository for the live webinar: *Linux Networking & Security Fundamentals*. 

You will find the lab guides for Day 1 and Day 2 within this repository as well as some other fun stuff. Enjoy!

> Note: Make sure that you have at least one Linux system (or virtual machine) ready to go! 

> To follow along with me I recommend a Debian server as well as a Linux client (Debian as a client, Fedora Workstation, or Ubuntu Desktop). You can find step-by-step instructions and videos about how to install Debian at my website: https://prowse.tech. And don't forget to subscribe for the latest updates!
